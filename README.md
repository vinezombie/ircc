`ircc` is a low-level IRC client for use in scripts,
built with [`vinezombie`](https://github.com/vinezombie/vinezombie).
It is comparable to [`ircdog`](https://github.com/ergochat/ircdog),
providing low-level access to the raw IRC protocol while
automating away much of the tedium.

## License

`ircc` is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 (only).
Disclosing the source code of bots written using `ircc` to
end users over IRC is also strongly encouraged, but not required.
